        'Good For the Skin\n\nIt has been used as medicine for burns and sores until today due to it’s effectiveness to reduce the healing time of burns. Also, aloe vera contains glucomannan, a polysaccharide, and gibberellin, a growth hormone. These works by interacting with growth factor receptors found on the fibro blast. As a result, the fibro blasts proliferation is triggered, increasing collagen synthesis. Hence, the process makes wound healing faster.',
    process:
        'To harvest your aloe plant for gel and juice:\n\n• Remove 3-4 leaves at a time, choosing thick leaves from the outer sections of the plant.\n•	Ensure the leaves are healthy and free of any mold or damage.\n•	Cut them close to the stem. Most of the beneficial nutrients are found at the base of the leaves.\n•	Avoid the roots.\n•	Wash and dry the leaves.\n•	Trim the prickly edges with a knife.\n•	Using a knife or your fingers, separate the interior gel from the outside of the leaf. The interior gel is the part of the aloe that you’ll use.\n•	Allow the yellow sap to drain from the leaf. This is the aloe vera latex. If you plan to use the latex, you can catch this in a container. If you’re not planning to use the latex, you can dispose of it.\n•	Cut the aloe gel into slices or cubes.\n\nHow to use fresh aloe gel:\n\nYou can apply fresh aloe gel directly to your skin or follow a recipe to make a homemade beauty product. It can also be added to food, smoothies, and drinks.\n\nTo make aloe juice, use 1 cup of liquid for every 2 tablespoons of aloe gel. Include any other ingredients, like fruit, and use a blender or food processor to mix up your drink.\n\nIf you’re planning to consume the fresh slices of aloe gel, it will keep in the refrigerator for a few days, but its best to consume it as quickly as possible. You can always store aloe vera gel in the freezer if you’re not ready to use it right away.',

Dandelion leaves and roots make a pleasant, but bitter tea. Flowers are fermented to make dandelion wine. Leaves and roots are used to flavor herbal beers and soft drinks.\n\nMedicinal Use:\nDandelion is a medicinal plant with bitter roots for gastrointestinal and liver problems, and leaves with a powerful diuretic effect. It is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making it a great general tonic. Dandelion root aids digestion, protects the liver from toxins, and treats liver hemorrhages. Dandelion leaves are diuretic and blood purifiers, stimulating the liver and gallbladder while eliminating toxins through urine production and excretion. Dandelion juice is used to treat skin wounds, corns, and warts, while dandelion sap is used to treat itches, ringworm, eczema, warts, and corns. Dandelion extracts are high in antioxidants, reducing free radicals and the risk of cancer. The plant also helps control blood sugar levels, regulates lipid levels, and acts as a disinfectant in urinary tract disorders. Researchers have shown that Dandelion Root and Burdock Root have potential in treating cancer. Overall, dandelion is a versatile and beneficial plant for overall health.',

The leaves are very narrow (6 to 16 inches long), while the flower stem is round. False garlic typically is from 5-22 inches in height. Flowers are white with a yellow base on the inside, about 1 inch in diameter, and have 6 perianth parts (petals and sepals). This species has two bracts that are located at the base of the inflorescence. This “odorless” species is similar to most other plants in the lily family in that it has a bulb. In the Great Plains, it flowers from April to May.\nIt is very common in yards, parks, roadsides and pastures. Seldom is it found in cropland fields, due to plowing. False garlic does not tolerate ponded or saturated soils, nor is it commonly found in harsh dry environments. Associated plants in Texas are henbit (Lamium amplexicaule), chickweed (Stellaria media), buttercups (Ranunculus spp.) and bedstraws (Galium spp.).',

    description:
        "The taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) is an herbaceous perennial, mostly cultivated as an annual. It grows up to a height of 2 m. Its adventicious and shallow root system arises from the corm, a swollen underground stem that contains high levels of fine starch and weighs up to 1 kg. Corms are usually cylindrical and 30 cm long x 15 cm diameter, but they are highly variable in size, shape and colour. The leaves are 30-90 cm long and 20-60 cm broad, and are borne in crowns at the end of upright, thick, succulent, 0.9-2 m high petioles. The inflorescence is a large pale green spathe (Ecoport, 2010; Safo Kantaka, 2004). There are hundreds of taro cultivars. Dasheen taros are wetland cultivars, mainly cultivated in Asia and the Pacific Islands. They have a single and large mealy corm (Ecoport, 2010). Eddoe taros are dryland cultivars, mainly cultivated in Africa and the Caribbean. They bear numerous smaller corms (cormels) around the central corm and have a firmer structure and a nutty taste (Ecoport, 2010; Onwueme et al., 1994). Taro yields high quantities of energy and protein per ha (Göhl, 1982). It is mainly cultivated for home consumption in Asia, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. The soft white-fleshed taro corms, usually called taro roots, are highly valued as a staple food and are eaten boiled, fried, roasted, fermented or turned into flour ('fufu' in West Africa), bread and biscuits. Low-grade corms are also used for alcohol production. Taro petioles and leaves are used as vegetable (Ecoport, 2010; Safo Kantaka, 2004; Wilson et al., 1996).Taro corms and peelings are fed to livestock, mainly cattle and pigs. In Vietnam, some taro varieties are used only for pigs (Ngo Huu Toan et al., 2010). In Hawaii, taro tops are used to make silage (Onwueme et al., 1994). Distribution Taro is native to India and the Malay peninsula, and is now cultivated throughout tropical and subtropical Asia, Pacific Islands (including northern Australia), the Caribbean and tropical Africa (from East to West). It was recently introduced in the southern USA (Onwueme et al., 1994; Ecoport, 2010).Optimal growth conditions are temperatures of 21-28°C, with an annual rainfall between 1800 and 2700 mm. Taro is found from sea-level up to an altitude of 1000 m or, close to the equator, 2300-2700 m (Ecoport, 2010; Wilson et al., 1996). It tolerates a wide range of sunlight conditions, from full sun to shaded conditions in intercropping systems with coconut, coffee or cocoa trees (Safo Kantaka, 2004). Wetland cultivars perform best on heavy soil with high-moisture-holding capacity, and pH ranging from 5.5 to 6.5. They tolerate flooded conditions and some varieties can grow under water (Ecoport, 2010; Safo Kantaka, 2004). Dryland cultivars prefer well-drained, deep, loamy and friable soils. They are drought hardy and tolerate waterlogged conditions and slight frosts (Ecoport, 2010; Onwueme et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 1996).",
